COM_AKEEBA_CONFIG_S3_DUALSTACK_TITLE="Enable IPv6 (dual-stack) support"
COM_AKEEBA_CONFIG_S3_DUALSTACK_DESCRIPTION="Should we use the dual-stack endpoints for Amazon S3? This allows accessing S3 over IPv6 for servers which support IPv6. Servers without IPv6 support will still be able to access S3 over IPv4. It has no effect if you are using a custom endpoint."

COM_AKEEBA_CONFIG_PERMISSIONS_TITLE="Archive permissions"
COM_AKEEBA_CONFIG_PERMISSIONS_DESCRIPTION="Set up the file permissions for the backup archive files. Only applies on Linux, macOS, BSD and other UNIX-style hosts (NOT Windows). If unsure leave as 0666. Changing that may make it impossible to download and / or delete backup archive files over FTP and SFTP. If your server is using PHP-FPM or otherwise runs PHP under the same user as your site's system account use 0600 for best security."
COM_AKEEBA_CONFIG_PERMISSIONS_0600="0600 – Tight security. might cause problems on low end servers"
COM_AKEEBA_CONFIG_PERMISSIONS_0644="0644 – Medium security, for use on single site servers"
COM_AKEEBA_CONFIG_PERMISSIONS_0666="0666 – Lax security, maximum compatibility with commercial hosts"

COM_AKEEBA_ALICE_ERR_NOLOGS="No log files for <strong>failed</strong> backups were found."
COM_AKEEBA_ALICE_HEAD_ONLYFAILED="ALICE only works on <em>failed</em> backups"
COM_AKEEBA_ALICE_LBL_ONLYFAILED_SHOWINGLOGS="ALICE is a tool to analyze the log files of <em>failed</em> backups and — in most cases — give you the most likely cause for the backup failure. It is not meant to analyse the log files of successful backups. Doing that would return nonsensical, misleading or outright wrong results. For this reason we will only show you the log files of <em>failed</em> backups."
COM_AKEEBA_ALICE_LBL_ONLYFAILED_WHATISFAILED="Please remember that backups which didn't finish uploading the backup archive to remote storage are not failed. The root cause for these problems cannot be detected by ALICE anyway. If you have this kind of problem you need to file a support ticket in our site's Support section. If someone else installed Akeeba Backup Professional for you on your site please contact that person instead; you won't be able to file a support ticket on our site in this case."
COM_AKEEBA_ALICE_LBL_ONLYFAILED_IFNOFAILED="If your backup failed but you do not see it on this page please wait for <em>three (3) minutes</em>, go back to the Akeeba Backup Control Panel page and then come back here. There's a reason for that. In some cases the backup failure is caused by a server error. In these cases the backup is marked as still-in-progress instead of failed since PHP stops running, therefore our PHP code which would mark the backup as failed doesn't get the chance to run. When you visit the Control Panel page any backup marked as still-in-progress for more than 3 minutes will be marked as failed. Hence the need to wait and <em>then</em> go back to the Control Panel page."
