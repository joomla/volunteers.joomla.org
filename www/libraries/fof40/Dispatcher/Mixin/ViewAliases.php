/**
 * Lets you create view aliases. When you access a view alias the real view is loaded instead. You can optionally have
 * an HTTPS 301 redirection for GET requests to URLs that use the view name alias.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This is a mixin (or, as we call it in PHP, a trait). Traits require PHP 5.4 or later. If you opt to use
 * this trait your component will no longer work under PHP 5.3.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * • Override $viewNameAliases with your view names map.
 * • If you want to issue HTTP 301 for GET requests set $permanentAliasRedirectionOnGET to true.
 * • If you have an onBeforeDispatch method remember to alias and call this traits' onBeforeDispatch method at the top.
 *
 * Regarding the last point, if you've never used traits before, the code looks like this. Top of the class:
 *   use ViewAliases {
 *       onBeforeDispatch as onBeforeDispatchViewAliases;
 *   }
 * and inside your custom onBeforeDispatch method, the first statement should be:
 *   $this->onBeforeDispatchViewAliases();
 * Simple!
